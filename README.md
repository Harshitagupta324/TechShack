## PROBLEM STATEMENT
More than 90,000 medical students graduate every year and every student reads at least 100 different books throughout their journey of becoming a specialist. 
* They find it difficult to store those study materials in an organised manner for the long run.
* E-books stored locally in the device takes up a lot of phoneâ€™s storage which will be an issue when one cannot delete the previously downloaded ebooks either to free up space. 
* At times, it is difficult to revise from the same book in which you have made notes previously because you see all the solved exercises instead of blank questions.
* While self-studying, sometimes students get stuck and are unable to understand a particular paragraph for which they have to rely on the internet or call their friend to ask the meaning which takes very much of their time.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION
We have ideated an app-based solution where we will provide them different facilities/features at a single place, where they can:
* Upload their personal hand-written notes for easy access and easily share these notes with their friends/others.
* Download and read e-books, make personalised notes in it.
* Ask doubts for a particular paragraph on a page.
* Download a new copy of the book without deleting their previous notes-ridden book.
* All the books/notes are stored over the cloud storage thus saving local storage space.
